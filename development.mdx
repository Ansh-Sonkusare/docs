<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You should have installed Node.js (version 16 or higher) and
  Docker.
</Info>

## Clone repo

Clone Clickvote repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clickvote/clickvote.git
```

This step should clone Clickvote repo into a `clickvote` folder on your computer.

## Start MongoDB and Redis

Go to `clickvote` folder and run the following command:

```bash
./start_services.sh
```

This command will create MongoDB and Redis Docker containers for you (you should have Docker daemon running). It will also attach Docker volumes
to these containers, so the data will persist between restarts.

By default MongoDB will be served at `mongodb://localhost:27017/clickvote` and Redis at `redis://localhost:6379`.

## Setup env variables

Run this command:

```bash
npm run setup
```

It will prompt you for env variables (you can use all default values if you started MongoDB and Redis using `./start_services.sh`).
Also this command will install all libraries for you.

## Run frontend and backend

```bash
npm run web
```

This command will run `frontend` and `backend` services. You can access `frontend` at `http://localhost:4200`, backend is running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Run websockets and consumers

Run this command:

```bash
npm run upvotes
```

It will run `websockets` and `consumers` services for you. `Websockets` are running at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Modify React component

If you want to modify Clickvote React component and see how it changes in realtime together with a live websocket connection, use this command:

```bash
npm run dev:react-component
```

It will start Storybook for your at `http://localhost:4400`. There you will be able to see how React components look like and even interact with them! (make sure `websockets` are running.)

To authenticate with `websockets` server, copy paste `public key` and `id` from a vote setup page (see [here](/quickstart#create-a-new-vote) how to create a new vote.)
